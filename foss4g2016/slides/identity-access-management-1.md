## Identity and Access Management

- Strenghten the separation of the **Authentication** phase from the **Authorization** and consequently the policies to be applied
- Achieve different strategies for **coarse-grained** and **fine-grained** *AuthZ* **policies** in a model
- **Plan** and **design** the roles before their number will become ungovernable and never relying on the application roles
