## Identity and Access Management

- User management and its lifecycle for the provisioning of identities has to be **central** in the **enterprise** (take security not seriously often means loss of control)
- Expect to challenge with different kind of security like **2-factor authN**, **Federation**, **Social authN**, **Mobile security**, **Multi steps authentication**, **Passwordless**, **User Managed Access**, etc for implementing a unique Single Sign-On that serves different web applications
- Expect to challenge with the management of **virtual user repositories** from different kinds of directory servers for Single Sign-On
